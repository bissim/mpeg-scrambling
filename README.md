# MPEG Scrambling
This is an academic project (without any kind of profit) for the [Data Compression](https://corsi.unisa.it/informatica-magistrale/didattica/insegnamenti?anno=2018&id=509903) lectures held by Professor [Bruno Carpentieri](https://rubrica.unisa.it/persone?matricola=001368).

Team BRS (owners and editors of this repository) only deals with porting **scrambling** implementation from Java to C; Java implementation of scrambling has been formerly authored by [Lorenzo Vitale](https://github.com/lorenzdev); previous work on watermarking has been authored by [Leo Aniello](mailto:aniello.leo@gmail.com)

_MPEG implementation and OpenCV library implementation belong to respective owners and are not product of our intellect_.
